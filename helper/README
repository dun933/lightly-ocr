OCR => localization => recognition
- goal: written purely in tensorflow and keras

- shares same backbone architecture => efficientnet
- localization: CRAFT
- recognizer: CRNN


- TODO:
    - added weight options in both efficientnet and resnet to use `imagenet` weights
    - consider transform image in data augmentation instead of STN

- localization: vgg16_unet => pseudo_gt => affinity and region

- recognizer: efficientnet => biLSTM => CTC
