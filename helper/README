OCR => detector => recognition
- shared same backbone for both stages
    - backbone: efficientNet vs resNet => DONE
    - detector : STN with locnet / CRAFT
    - sequence labeling : biLSTM => DONE
    - prediction layer: Attention/CTC => DONE


- backbone:efficientNet vs resNet
    - implements residual network
    - efficientnetB3's params: 10M whereas resnet's are 23M => smaller architecture yet claimed to be perform better than resnet
