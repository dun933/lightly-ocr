OCR => detector => recognition
- shared same backbone for both stages
- backbone: efficientNet vs resNet => DONE (refers to tensorflow.keras)
- detector:
    - bbox: YOLOv1
- recognition:
    - feature extraction: refers to backbone
    - sequence labeling : biLSTM => DONE
    - transcriptiion layer: Attention/CTC => DONE

- TODO:
    - added weight options in both efficientnet and resnet to use `imagenet` weights
    - consider transform image in data augmentation instead of STN


- backbone:efficientNet vs resNet
    - implements residual network
    - efficientnetB3's params: 10M whereas resnet's are 23M => smaller architecture yet claimed to be perform better than resnet
